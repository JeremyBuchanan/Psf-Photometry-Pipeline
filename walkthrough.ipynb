    "The telescope images I worked with where taken of a young binary star by the name StHÎ±-34. The images came in 3 separate color bands of visible light: U band, V band, and Z band (in order from shortest to longest wavelength). Each color band contained around 125 image sets, and each image set usually contained 3 images, for a total of just over 1000 total images, each contained in its own FITS file. Out of concern for over-exposure, images where taken in a short-exposure burst of 3 images. The script performs photometry on a median composite of each image set. For a better theoretical understanding of the project for which this package was developed, I have a shorter paper simplifying some of the theory of binary star accretion [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v-OLpeAwAxZ_o04SSG4qDhjf2u3Ahn1s/view?usp=sharing)\n",

In short terms, changes to the target's brightness are tracked by comparing how the target appears in context of the stars around it. Occasionally, one of the stars near the target will appear much brighter, perhaps due to a hot pixel on the telescope chip, or another obstruction. The issue can be solved by removing the very bright (or very dim) star from the context of the target, or in extreme cases by removing the bad image set entirely.\n",
